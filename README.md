# Simulating Drug distribution and consumption within a body
This project was done in the course of the MAT292, Ordinary Differential Equations Class at U of T. The purpose of this code is to simulate how an antihistamine would be absorbed and how long it would last within the body for a given concentration. This method has succesfully shown to be able to assume a distribution similar to that observed in literatrue, but has the following assumptions: The drug is equally soluble in all environments of the body, but cannot stay in tisues other than the reaction site, the blood, fats, and the digestive tract. Based on the literature, generally 2/3 is lost. From there, it can be simulated within all body systems as described above. The antihistamine is assued to be evenly distributed in the blood.

For all code, You must download the code file and the corresponding RK solver for the code to work.
