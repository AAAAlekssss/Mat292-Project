# Simulating Drug distribution and consumption within a body
This project was done in the course of the MAT292, Ordinary Differential Equations Class at U of T. The purpose of this MATLAB code is to simulate how an antihistamine would be absorbed and how long it would last within the body for a given concentration. This method has succesfully shown to be able to assume a distribution similar to that observed in literatrue, but has the following assumptions: The drug is equally soluble in all environments of the body, but cannot stay in tisues other than the reaction site, the blood, fats, and the digestive tract. Based on the literature, generally 2/3 is lost. From there, it can be simulated within all body systems as described above. The antihistamine is assumed to be evenly distributed in the blood instantaneously.

For all code, You must download the code file and the corresponding RK solver for the code to work.

All code must be in the Same MATLAB folder to work. Sample solution PDFs are in the sample solutions section.

To keep code running in under 2 minutes, use the sample test cases, as up to 36 graphs were generated in 2 minutes during our tests!

PDFs in the graphs section are a sample output from our 4 compartment models, one varying diffusion speeds between compartments, and one varying masses, and parts of mass for each body system
